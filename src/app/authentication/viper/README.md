## Viper Architecture in TypeScript

The Viper architecture (**View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router**) is a design pattern that provides a clear separation of concerns by dividing an application into distinct layers. This enhances modularity, testability, and maintainability.

### Components of Viper

#### View ####

- Responsibilities:
  - Displays the UI and handles user interactions.
  - Sends user actions to the Presenter.
  - Receives updates from the Presenter to refresh the UI.

#### Interactor ####

- Responsibilities:
  - Contains the business logic of the application.
  - Fetches or updates data from the repository or service.
  - Validates inputs and processes data as needed.

#### Presenter ####

- Responsibilities:
  - Acts as an intermediary between the View and Interactor.
  - Converts data from the Interactor to a format suitable for the View.
  - Handles UI logic and updates the View.

#### Entity ####

- Responsibilities:
  - Defines the data model for the application.
  - Represents the structure of the data being handled.

#### Router ####

- Responsibilities:
  - Manages navigation within the application.
  - Decides which view to display based on user actions or application state.

### Benefits of Using Viper

- **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility, reducing complexity and improving code organization.
- **Testability**: Each layer can be tested independently, making it easier to write unit tests.
- **Modularity**: Promotes reusability and makes it easier to maintain and scale the application.
- **Maintainability**: Changes in one component have minimal impact on others, simplifying maintenance.
