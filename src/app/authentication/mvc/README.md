## MVC (Model-View-Controller) Pattern in TypeScript

The MVC pattern is a widely used architectural design pattern that divides an application into three interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This structure helps in separating concerns, making the application easier to understand, develop, and maintain.

### Components of MVC

#### Model

- Represents the data and business logic of the application.
- Manages the application's data, logic, and rules.
- Interacts with the database or external services for data persistence.

#### View

- Presents the data to the user.
- Displays the UI components and handles user interactions.
- Receives input from the user and sends commands to the controller or model.

#### Controller

- Acts as an intermediary between the model and the view.
- Processes user input and invokes changes on the model or view based on that input.
- Updates the model when the user manipulates the view.

### Benefits of Using MVC

- **Separation of Concerns**: Dividing the application into three distinct components reduces complexity and improves code organization.
- **Modularity**: Each component (model, view, controller) can be developed and tested independently, promoting code reusability.
- **Scalability**: MVC facilitates scalability by allowing developers to modify or extend one component without affecting the others.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to one component are less likely to impact other parts of the application, making maintenance easier.
